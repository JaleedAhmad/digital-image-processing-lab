# Image Processing Lab

Welcome to the **Image Processing Lab**, a repository showcasing three distinct image processing projects implemented in Python and MATLAB. This collection is designed for enthusiasts and researchers to explore techniques in document processing, noise analysis, and color segmentation.

## Projects

- **[Document Dewarping](document-dewarping/)**: Corrects distortions in scanned documents using Python and OpenCV, with potential GUI support.
- **[Noise Estimation](noise-estimation/)**: Analyzes and removes various noise types (e.g., Gaussian, Salt & Pepper) from images using MATLAB.
- **[Color Segmentation](color-segmentation/)**: Segments image regions by color (HSV/RGB thresholding) using Python, with optional GUI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: For Document Dewarping and Color Segmentation (install OpenCV via `pip install opencv-python`).
- **MATLAB**: For Noise Estimation (ensure MATLAB is installed with Image Processing Toolbox).
- **Git**: To clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-lab.git`).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to each project folder and follow the specific setup instructions in the respective `README.md`.
